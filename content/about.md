Hi there! I'm Ryo Nakao.

I'm a software engineer with a couple of years of experience working on [fancy projects](https://github.com/nakabonne); also am a maintainer of [PipeCD](https://github.com/pipe-cd/pipe).

Writing helps me clear up my thoughts, that's why I keep blogging.

What I value are:

- Joy - that's the reason why I live
- Curiosity - no greater pleasure than learning something new
- Simplicity - always looking for the simplest solution
