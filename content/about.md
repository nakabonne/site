Hi there! I'm Ryo Nakao.

I'm a software engineer, quite interested in reducing the cycle time between an idea and usable software.

Writing helps me clear up my thoughts, that's why I keep blogging.

## Projects
I’ve done a couple of (hopefully) interesting things over the last few years. The noteworthy projects I’ve written are:

#### ***[ali](https://github.com/nakabonne/ali) - A load testing tool aimed to perform real-time analysis***
A load testing tool capable of performing real-time analysis, inspired by vegeta and jplot.

#### ***[pbgopy](https://github.com/nakabonne/pbgopy) - Copy and paste between devices***
pbgopy acts like pbcopy/pbpaste but for multiple devices. It lets you share data across devices like you copy and paste.

#### ***[gosivy](https://github.com/nakabonne/gosivy) - Real-time visualization tool for Go process metrics***
Gosivy tracks Go process's metrics and plot their evolution over time right into your terminal, no matter where it's running on. It helps you understand how your application consumes the resources.

#### ***[PipeCD](https://github.com/pipe-cd/pipe) - A unified continuous delivery solution for multiple application kinds***
A GitOps tool that enables doing deployment operations by pull request on Git.

#### ***[golintui](https://github.com/nakabonne/golintui) - A simple terminal UI for Go linters***
golintui is a TUI tool that helps you run various kinds of linters with ease and organize its results, with the power of golangci-lint.

#### ***[nestif](https://github.com/nakabonne/nestif) - Detect deeply nested if statements in Go source code***
Reports deeply nested if statements in Go code, by calculating its complexities based on the rules defined by the Cognitive Complexity white paper by G. Ann Campbell.
