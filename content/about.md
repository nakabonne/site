Hi there! I'm Ryo Nakao.

I'm a software engineer, quite interested in reducing the cycle time between an idea and usable software.

Writing helps me clear up my thoughts, that's why I keep blogging.

## Projects
The most noteworthy projects Iâ€™ve written in the past or currently maintaining are:
- ***[ali](https://github.com/nakabonne/ali)***: A load testing tool aimed to perform real-time analysis
- ***[PipeCD](https://github.com/pipe-cd/pipe)***: Continuous Delivery for Declarative Kubernetes, Serverless and Infrastructure Applications
- ***[golintui](https://github.com/nakabonne/golintui)***: A simple terminal UI for Go linters
