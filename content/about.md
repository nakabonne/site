Hi there! I'm Ryo Nakao.

I'm a software engineer, quite interested in reducing the cycle time between an idea and usable software.

Writing helps me clear up my thoughts, that's why I keep blogging.

# Projects
I’ve done a couple of (hopefully) interesting things over the last few years. The noteworthy projects I’ve written are:

#### *[ali](https://github.com/nakabonne/ali) - A load testing tool aimed to perform real-time analysis*

#### *[pbgopy](https://github.com/nakabonne/pbgopy) - Copy and paste between devices*

#### *[gosivy](https://github.com/nakabonne/gosivy) - Real-time visualization tool for Go process metrics*

#### *[PipeCD](https://github.com/pipe-cd/pipe) - A unified continuous delivery system*

#### *[golintui](https://github.com/nakabonne/golintui) - A simple terminal UI for Go linters*

#### *[nestif](https://github.com/nakabonne/nestif) - Detect deeply nested if statements in Go source code*
